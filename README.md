# Wicked-Scheduler

A program that will automatically scrape all classes from Michigan Technological University and allow users to pick classes that they desire. The scheduler will then try and create a valid schedule given the classes that the user wants.

## Overview

When the program first loads up it will load all classes available for the chosen semester and then save it to a file for easier access later. Below you can see a preview of the main menu that will allow you to add or remove classes through the use of buttons or drag-and-drop. It also allows ones to search for classes so that they could be found easier.

Once a user chooses their classes they can click "Create Schedule" where all possible schedules will be created, but limited to only 3 visible (Support for more will be added later). If a user sees a schedule that they like they can press the "Get CRNs" button in order to get the CRNs of the courses within that schedule so that a user may sign up for the courses. Below you will find a example of the schedule view
